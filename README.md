# luminol_kinetics
Can we fit the kinetic law of the Luminol + Fe3+ reaction with a video analysis?

This was part of a chemistry project during my 1st year of Preparatory Classes (CPGE, equivalent to a 1st year of Bachelor). 
Goal: Measure the concentration of reactant over time to infer the reaction's kinetic law.
Method:
Perform the reaction in th dark while recording it with a smartphone. Apply a custom Python script for image/video analysis to link luminosity with luminol concentration over time.
Apply kinetic methods seen in class to calculate kinetic constants and try to fit a kintic law. 

Perspectives: Benchmark luminosity  vs light intensity to verify the relation used in the script to calulate concentration over time.
